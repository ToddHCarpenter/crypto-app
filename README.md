#Cryptop App
Using Rapid API I am able to get the current status of the top 100 coins from https://coinranking1.p.rapidapi.com.
I also use https://bing-news-search1.p.rapidapi.com to get the latest news for each coin.
The UI of this project leverages antd for its design and Redux for its state management.
